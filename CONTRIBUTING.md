# Contributing to Connect OER

Thank you for your interest in [Connect OER](https://connect.sparcopen.org/)!

The source code of Connect OER has been released under a permissive license to let you study exactly how the application works. Feel free to play and reuse any parts of the code. We may do more releases in the future after significant updates or when the data model changes substantially.

We currently do not have processes or resources in place to support the development of this project on GitHub. However, we wanted to provide access to the code right away in keeping with SPARC's commitment to setting the default to open.

We welcome you to contribute to Connect OER by signing up your institution to participate (more details [here](https://connect.sparcopen.org)). We also publish an [open dataset](https://github.com/sparcopen/connect-oer-data), which may be useful to you.

If you use our code or data, we hope you will let us know! Contact Brady Yano at [brady@sparcopen.org](mailto:brady@sparcopen.org).
